## GamePlay - next generation engine

## Design Goals for next generation engine:

* Re-use core classes from existing framework
* Modern C++ 11 API (ex. unique_ptr and shared_ptr, auto, etc)
* Abstract GraphicsDevice (Vulkan, Direct3D12 and Metal impl.)
* Replace Lua with Javascript/Typescript via v8
* Replace Properties with Serializer/Serialable (json and binary impl)
* Replace Bullet physics with PhysX
* Add SceneRenderer (Deferred shading + PBR + image based lighting)
* Game Editor (using Qt 5.6+)
* Web/Cloud Assets, Samples and Projects


### Issues
* Please do not submit external issues until project is further along.
